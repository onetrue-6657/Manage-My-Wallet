--- **Update 2024/10/31** ---
The most basic framework has been done, including basic expenses list, add expense, and visualize expense categories using a pie chart.
Most bugs have been fixed. 
Optimized GUI and added the most basic filter.

--- **Planned** ---
The project has only finished the framework of its front-end website service. There are still a lot of operations and elements on developing on the front-end. 
I also plan to develop a back-end, which will be useful to handle user data and add a login account feature.
In the future I may make mobile apps for this program.

--- **Declaration** ---
This is both a program for utilization and personal full-stack development practice, so some AI is used in the process. 
Despite this, AI-generated codes are strictly limited in the process of development. They are primarily used for fixing bugs and errors.
This has not been a mature and comprehensive program yet, so take the risk of losing data when using it.
